# PEEK-300_Firmware

This repo has been created to customize Marlin for use on the CreatBot PEEK-300.  The starting code is the firmware as recieved from CreatBot, NOT stock Marlin firmware.  It's my opinion that CreatBot did a poor job when setting up the firmware, leaving many good features unused.
